BOA - Buffer Overrun Analyzer
=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

Boa requires the installation of libglpk, llvm, libllvm and clang.
On a Ubuntu 10.10 system, those can be installed by running:
    sudo apt-get install clang libglpk-dev

(clang's dependencies include llvm and libllvm).

To run unit tests, the `googletest` testing suite is also required,
see instructions in the bottom of this document.

In order to compile simply run
    $ make

In order to test run
    $ make tests

In order to run
    $ ./boa tests/testcases/simple1.c  # (or any other c source file)

Or -
    $ ./boa
for brief help
